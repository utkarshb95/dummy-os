/** ASSIGNMENT OVERVIEW:
  * - Fill out and complete the TASKS 1-4 below. Description of each task and 
  *   helpful hints are also provided.
  * - The following structure is followed for each layer that you will be implementing.
  *   The parent folder (MATIntro) contains the following files:
  *   -- export.h => These functions will be exposed to other layers of the
  *                  kernel for use.
  *   -- test.c => Contains the test cases for the tasks in this layer (MATIntro).
  *                Make sure you pass all of the test cases before moving on to the
  *                next layer.
  *   -- Makefile.inc => Contains the build information for this layer.
  *   Note: Other layers may consist of the following file:
  *   -- import.h => Contains the functions that are available to you to complete the 
  *                  tasks in that layer. 
  *                    
  * ASSIGNMENT INFO:
  * - In this section, you will implement the getter and setter functions
  *   for manipulating the Allocation Table (AT) data-structure.
  * - AT data-structure represents represents one physical page (AKA frame)
  *   of physical memory. Hence an array of AT is used to represent the 
  *    entire physical memory.
