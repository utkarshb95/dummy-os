/** - SContainer is an object used to keep track of the resource usage of each process,
  *    as well as the parent/child relationships between processes.
  * - To describe containers in more detail, we first need to define a way to
  *   distinguish a particular process. We do this via unique IDs. Whenever a
  *   process is spawned, it is assigned an unused ID in some range [0, NUM_IDS).
  *   Every ID has an associated container. ID 0 is reserved for the kernel itself.
  * - For our kernel, we will define a parent/child relationship between IDs,
  *   and we require that parents choose resources to pass on to their children.
  *   Each ID has a single parent, and potentially multiple children.
  *   ID 0 is called the "root", as it is the root of the parent/child tree and thus
  *   the only container without a parent.
  *
  * - We create an array of SContainer data-structure to keep track
  *   of resources for all processes.
  * - For more information check the project description.
